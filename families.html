    <h3 align=center>Hydrozoa</h3>
    <p align=center>Polyps. Polyps are colonial hydroids; mainly staying in groups. However, most species are no longer than a couple centimeters, with others being 2 meters long! But these little guys have no stingers, and are sedimentary. However, the Medusae hydroids are the general idea when it comes to jellies. Most species have tentacles (stinger-ful), oral arms, a bell-hood, and a mouth, eye-spots, and are very mobile. They can be anywhere from a tenth of a centimeter to 36.6 meters (120 feet) in length! Some are lethal (box jelly) to harmless (moon jellies). But no matter what color, size, shape you can imagine, there is definitely a Medusae out there perfectly resembling it.</p>

    <h3 align=center>Polypodium Hydriforme</h3>
    <p align=center>These little buggers are not actual jellies, but are a lower classification of jellies. They are parasites that attack the eggs of Sturgeons and fish of that nature, and have the strangest life cycle. These creatures are an inverted Medusae cell. They infect the egg, taking it as their own to become an inside-out stolon. The Polypodium then everts to normal cell layers, sprouting tentacles on the stolon. Once the stolon is free from the egg, it breaks into medusae-like creatures that go on to create more like it.</p>

    <h3 align=center>Siphonophorae</h3>
    <p align=center>Siphonophorae are a classification of Medusae. Whilst looking like one animal, a Siph. is actually a colony of creatures called zooids. They are almost always long, thin, and have little to no movement, and rely on drifting in the ocean as a means of movement. This is why so many people see Portuguese Man-o-Wars wash up on beaches so frequently. The zooids are often strung together to make a Siph., and can also be combined with other lower classifications of jellies. E.i. on a Portuguese man-o-war, the top frill is not a Zooid, but actually a Polypodiium! None the less, these species seem to be the most dangerous, so steer clear.</p>

    <h3 align=center>Stauromedusae</h3>
    <p align=center>Stauromedusae are "stalked jellyfish". This means they are Polyps and Medusae babies. However, these do not live a sedimentary life, stuck to a rock/seabed/whatever they can stick to. They can shuffle along whatever surface they are on and gradually move. Very similar to starfish, however! These guys have tentacles facing up! They range from a few centimeters to a max of 6 inches tall, but they still pack a punch. The stingers are all located on the oral arms, not the pertruding tentacles. But if you are to get stung be warned! Some ARE harmles, but some can cause cramping, fever, and even death. So do be warned with these. The other problem is they love th ecold, shallow shores so are extrmely similar to sea anenomes to a degree. But these guys arent afraid to sting and will if they have to, so never judge a book by its cover!</p>
