    <p align="center">Jellyfish. Jellyfish are one of the most misunderstood creatures on planet earth. Yet we feel we know so much about them; how dangerous they are, how many there are, etc. But with so many different families, types, colors and shapes it's hard to distinguish between a nettle and a hydrozoan. But, nevertheless, each family is related to the basic species of jellyfish. Thought of as merely floating blobs in the ocean, there is far more to these elegant and beautiful creatures than you think.</p>
