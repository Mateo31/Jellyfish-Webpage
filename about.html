    <h3 align=center>The Simplest</h3>
    <p align=center>Jellyfish have to be one of the simplest multi-celled animals (excluding the lesser-celled animals e.i. Ameoba) in existance. Jellyfish have no brains. No heart. And no blood. But, they have mouths. Underneath the big mess that is the "Oral arms" is a mouth that feeds on plankton and zoo(smaller)plankton. With no brains, organs, etc. the jellyfishes nervous system and sensory structure are highly improved compared to our own, and are able to recognize light and smell very quickly, allowing it to swiftly catch food. Most people think the jellyfish utilizes its bell hood as a means of transportation; unbeknownst to most it has dual features. It not only acts as a motor for the jellyfish, but also creates a current, catching plankton along the way! However, not all jellyfish have the tentacles and some, mainly Jellyfish in the Order ‘Rhizostomae’, have anywhere from 6-10 barrel-shaped Oral arms. However, most jellyfish with tentacle AND oral arms have the coated in thousands of tiny nematocysts, the venomous cell that stings you when the jellyfish senses a threat. Most of the time, the jellyfish keeps them curled in, until it is ready to attack! Jellyfish also, shockingly, have eye spots! little is known (as far as my research can tell) about how the jellyfish utilizes this, especially without a brain.</p>

    <h3 align=center>The most Elagent</h3>
    <p align=center>Jellyfish are easily one of the most beautiful animals in the world. In fact, according to Fox News, Cnidarians (a family of jellyfish with few tentacles) are the 19th most beautiful creature in the world (<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/science/slideshow/2013/08/31/24-worlds-most-beautiful-creatures.html#/slide/chameleon">Fox News</a>). Of course this proclamation is opinion based, but it gives a rough idea of just how beautiful jellyfish can be. Most jellyfish come in Orange, white, or translucent blue colors. However, some jellies can be anything from pink to purple, green to yellow, and even brown. But, jellyfish are not all jellyfish have a perfect bell-shaped hood. Some species (like the Cauliflower or Crown Jellies) have Cheerio shaped hood; One that doesnt cover their entire head.
