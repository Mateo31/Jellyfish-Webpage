    <h3 align=center>The Simplest</h3>
    <p align=center>Jellyfish have to be one of the simplest multi-celled animals (excluding the lesser-celled animals e.i. Ameoba) in existance. Jellyfish have no brains. No heart. And no blood. But, they have mouths. Underneath the big mess that is the "Oral arms" is a mouth that feeds on plankton and zoo(smaller)plankton. With no brains, organs, etc. the jellyfishes nervous system and sensory structure are highly improved compared to our own, and are able to recognize light and smel very quickly, allowing it to swiftly catch food. Most people think the jellyfish utilizes its bell hood as a means of transportation; unbeknownst to most it has dual features. It not only acts as a motor for the jellyfish, but also creates a current, catching plankton along the way! However, not all jellyfish have the tentacles and some, mainly Jellyfish in the Order ‘Rhizostomae’, </p>
